GStreamer use a *large* array of tools and libraries, most of which are
optional.  We have attempted to make sure that any code that depends on
optional libraries doesn't get built unless you have those libraries.  If
you find this not to be the case, please, let us know by filing a bug
report at http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=1936.


Required libraries:
===================
glib v1.2.0 or better
gtk+ v1.2.0 or better
libxml

Optional libraries:
===================
gdk_pixbuf	(for videosink)
libghttp	(for httpsrc)
libgnomeui	(for gstplay, gsteditor, autoplug example, several tests)
libglade	(for gstplay, gsteditor)



An extra set of tools is required if you wish to build GStreamer out of
CVS (using autogen.sh):

autoconf
automake v1.4 or better
libtool v1.3.5 or better

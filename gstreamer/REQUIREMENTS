GStreamer use a *large* array of tools and libraries, most of which are
optional.  We have attempted to make sure that any code that depends on
optional libraries doesn't get built unless you have those libraries.  If
you find this not to be the case, please, let us know by filing a bug
report at http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=1936.


Required libraries:
===================
glib v1.2.0 or better
gtk+ v1.2.0 or better
libxml          (also called gnome-xml, available from http://xmlsoft.org/)

These libraries are all central parts of gnome, and are available from the
ftp.gnome.org or its mirrors, amongst other places.

Optional libraries:
===================
gdk_pixbuf
libgnomeui	(for gstplay, gsteditor, autoplug example, several tests)
libglade	(for gstplay, gsteditor)
libHermes	(for gstplay)

libghttp	(for httpsrc)
libXv		(for videosink)
libxaudio	(for xa mp3 decoder)
libvorbis	(for vorbisenc, vorbisdec)
libcdparanoia	(for cdparanoia ripper)
liblame		(for lame mp3 encoder)
libshout	(for the shoutcast plugin)
libasound	(for the alsa src/sink plugin)
librtp		(for the rtp sink plugin)

for AVI playback you might want to get the windows libraries from
http://divx.euro.ru/ and put the .dll files in /usr/lib/win32/

An extra set of tools is required if you wish to build GStreamer out of
CVS (using autogen.sh):

Required tools:
===============
autoconf
automake v1.4 or better
libtool v1.3.5 or better

Optional tools:
===============
gtkdoc
db2html
fig2dev

Optional debian packages:
=========================
(This is an incomplete list, made only of problems which have been reported,
rather than by an audit.)
task-helix-gnome-dev   OR libgnome-dev

gtk-doc-tools 0.4-0.2  -- needed to build documentation

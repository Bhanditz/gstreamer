/* HOW THIS WORKS:
 *
 * The fundamental structure is a singly-linked list of buffers.  The
 * buffer on the front is the oldest, and thus the first to read data
 * from.  The number of bytes left to be read in this buffer is stored
 * in bs->headbufavail.  The number of bytes available in the entire
 * list (including the head buffer) is in bs->listavail.
 *
 * When a request is made for data (peek), _fill_bytes is called with
 * the number of bytes needed, but only if the listavail indicates
 * that there aren't already enough.  This calls _get_next_buf until
 * the listavail is sufficient to satisfy the demand.
 *
 * _get_next_buf pulls a buffer from the pad the bytestream is attached
 * to, and shoves it in the list.  There are actually two things it can
 * do.  If there's already a buffer in the list, and the _is_span_fast()
 * test returns true, it will merge it with that last buffer.  Otherwise
 * it will simply tack it onto the end of the list.
 *
 * The _peek itself first checks the simple case of the request fitting
 * within the head buffer, and if so creates a subbuffer and returns.
 * Otherwise, it creates a new buffer and allocates space for the request
 * and calls _assemble to fill it.  We know we have to copy because this
 * case only happens when the _merge wasn't feasible during _get_next_buf.
 *
 * The _flush method repeatedly inspects the head buffer and flushes as
 * much data from it as it needs to, up to the size of the buffer.  If
 * the flush decimates the buffer, it's stripped, unref'd, and removed.

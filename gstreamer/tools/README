gstreamer-launch
================

This is a tool that will construct pipelines based on a command-line
syntax.  The syntax is rather complex to enable all the features I want it
to have, but should be easy to use for most people.  Multi-pathed and
feedback pipelines are the most complex.

A simple commandline looks like:

./launch disksrc demo.mp3 | mp3parse | mpg123 | osssink

A more complex pipeline looks like:

./launch disksrc redpill.vob | css-descramble | private_stream_1.0| \
(ac3parse | ac3dec | audioink-oss) video_0| (mpeg2dec | videosink)

gstreamer-launch
================

This is a tool that will construct pipelines based on a command-line
syntax.  The syntax is rather complex to enable all the features I want it
to have, but should be easy to use for most people.  Multi-pathed and
feedback pipelines are the most complex.

A simple commandline looks like:

 ./launch disksrc demo.mp3 | mp3parse | mpg123 | osssink

A more complex pipeline looks like:

 ./launch disksrc redpill.vob | css-descramble | private_stream_1.0| \
  (ac3parse | ac3dec | audioink-oss) video_0| (mpeg2dec | videosink)


gstreamer-complete
==================

This is a simple utility which provides custom bash completion when
typing gstreamer-launch commands.

Simply run "gstreamer-compprep" to build the registry of completions, and
then put, in your .bashrc,
"complete -C gstreamer-complete gstreamer-launch"
(ensuring that gstreamer-complete is on your path).

You can then enjoy context sensitive tab-completion of gstreamer-launch
commands.


gstreamer-register
==================

This tool will perform an introspection on all available plugins and will
create a registry file in /etc/gstreamer/reg.xml. Startup time will be
much faster since the gstreamer core doesn't have to bring all the plugins 
files into memory at startup.


gstreamer-inspect
=================

Allows you to check the properties of plugins and elements.

 ./gstreamer-inspect 
 
will show all the plugins available and the elements they contain.

 ./gstreamer-inspect <pluginname/elementname>

shows more info about the plugin/element.

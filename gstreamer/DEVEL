Development Notes and Random Wisdom

* in libs like dparams, include the respective dparam headers with
  #include "dparams.h"
  instead of
  #include <gst/libs/control/dparams.h>
  because the latter will, if the include flags are set that way, first look
  for the installed headers instead of the newest one, which is in your source
  dir.

* When doing releases, please follow the guidelines in docs

Building GStreamer documentation


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

To build the GStreamer documentation you need the following installed (based on Red Hat packages). 
These packages comes from rawhide and are the ones that will be in Red Hat 7.3/8.0

Docbook stuff:
sgml-common 
xml-common 
openjade (needs to be rebuilt from SRPM for Red Hat 7.2)
tetex-dvips
jadetex
docbook-dtds      
docbook-style-dsssl 
docbook-style-xsl
docbook-utils

XML stuff:
libxml2
libxml2-python
libxml2-devel
libxslt
libxslt-devel
libxslt-python



Gtkdoc:
gtk-doc

Other stuff:
transfig
pdftops





DEVHELP INTEGRATION
-------------------
Check http://www.imendio.com/projects/devhelp/
It's a really nice development app allowing you to look up API stuff
from various gtk-doc'd libraries.  GStreamer is one of these ;)

gtk-doc generates both html API docs and the matching .devhelp files

	* gst/gstpad.c:
	  Rearrange/rewrite much of the pad negotiation code, since it
	  resembled pasta.  This actually changes the way some
	  negotiation works, since the previous code was inconsistent
	  depending on how it was invoked.  Add (internal) structure
	  GstPadLink, which is used to hold some information (more in
	  the future) about the link between two pads.  Fixes a number
	  of bugs, including random lossage of filter caps when the
	  initial negotiation is delayed.  A few functions are still
	  unimplemented.
	* gst/gstpad.h:
	  Add GST_PAD_LINK_{SUCESSFUL|FAILED}() macros.  Please use
	  these when testing GstPadLinkReturn values instead of comparing
	  directly.

	* gst/gstvalue.c: 
	* gst/gstvalue.h:
	  Rearrange lots of code.  Change registration of compare function
	  into registration of compare/serialize/deserialize functions.
	  Doesn't include implementation of gst_value_[de]serialize(),
	  but that should be easy.

	* docs/gst/gstreamer-sections.txt:
	* docs/gst/tmpl/gstprops.sgml: removed
        * docs/gst/tmpl/gstreamer-bufferpool.sgml: removed
          David removed props and caps code, so let's remove their docs as well.
          Removed all no longer existing symbols from gstreamer-sections.txt

	* gst/gsttaginterface.c, gst/gsttaginterface.h,
	  gst/gsttag.c, gst/gsttag.h:  Add interface to setting GValues
	  of tags directly.

2003-12-22  Benjamin Otte  <in7y118@public.uni-hamburg.de>

	* gst/elements/gstelements.c:
	  Set ranks of elements to NONE, so the autoplugger doesn't use them.
	* gst/elements/gstshaper.c: (gst_shaper_getcaps):
	  Fix proxying to new CAPS stuff. Don't call get_allowed_caps but
	  gst_caps (peer).

2003-12-22  Benjamin Otte  <in7y118@public.uni-hamburg.de>

	* gst/autoplug/gstsearchfuncs.c: (gst_autoplug_caps_intersect):
	* gst/autoplug/gstspideridentity.c: (gst_spider_identity_link),
	(gst_spider_identity_getcaps), (gst_spider_identity_change_state),
	(gst_spider_identity_sink_loop_type_finding):
	* gst/autoplug/gstspideridentity.h:
	  Fix autoplugging in spider element, so it works with new caps.
	  This was mainly caused by identifying empty caps incorrectly.

2003-12-22  David Schleef  <ds@schleef.org>

	* gststructure.c, gstvalue.c, gstvalue.h: Add
	  gst_value_init_and_copy() and use it, to avoid silly mistakes in
	  using g_value_copy()

2003-12-21  David Schleef  <ds@schleef.org>

	* many, many files: Merge CAPS branch.  This includes:
	  - implemention of GstValue and several GstValue types
	  - implemention of GstStructure
	  - entire rewrite of GstCaps
	  - removal of GstProps
	  - many changes to GstPad to compensate for new caps paradigm
	  - removal of GstBufferpool
	* gst/Makefile.am, gst/gst.h, gst/gstpad.h, gst/gsttypefind.h,
	gstvalue.h, gst/gstcaps[2]*.[ch]:
	  - rename gstcaps2.[ch] to gstcaps.[ch]

	* gst/gstqueue.c: (gst_queue_handle_pending_events),
	(gst_queue_chain), (gst_queue_handle_src_event):
	  implement timeout for sending events. Workaround for if the
	  pipeline on this queue is not passing any data.

        * ChangeLog: moved to gstreamer/docs/random/old/ChangeLog.gstreamer
        * moved CVS to freedesktop.org

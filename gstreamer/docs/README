GTK-DOC stuff
-------------

* starting files in CVS:
  - Makefile.am
  - gstreamer-sections.txt, gstreamer.types.in, gstreamer-docs.sgml
  - tmpl/

* what is done in the gst dir ?

- headers are scanned based on $(MODULE).types
  $(MODULE)-scan is created
  gtkdoc-scan is called with a sourcedir and a module name,
  where the module name is  $(MODULE)
  $(MODULE)-sections.txt is created if it doesn't exist yet (it should),
  as well as $(MODULE)-decl.txt and $(MODULE)-decl-list.txt
    
  and .args, .hierarchy and .signals files are created
  gtkdoc-scan is called 


* TODO:
  why is there gstreamer.types.in and gst-plugins.types.in ?

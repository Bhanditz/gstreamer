    You can link the different pads of elements together so that the elements
    form a chain.

  <para> 
    By linking these three elements, we have created a very simple
    chain. The effect of this will be that the output of the source element
    (element1) will be used as input for the filter element (element2). The
    filter element will do something with the data and send the result to
    the final sink element (element3).

  <para> 
    Imagine the above graph as a simple MPEG audio decoder. The source
    element is a disk source, the filter element is the MPEG decoder and
    the sink element is your audiocard. We will use this simple graph to
    construct an MPEG player later in this manual.

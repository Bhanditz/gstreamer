    You can connect the different pads of elements together so that the elements
    form a chain.

    By connecting these three elements, we have created a very simple pipeline. The effect
    of this will be that the output of the source element (element1) will be used as input 
    for the filter element (element2). The filter element will do something with the data and 
    send the result to the final sink element (element3).

    Imagine the above graph as a simple mpeg audio decoder. The source element is a 
    disk source, the filter element is the mpeg decoder and the sink element is your
    audiocard. We will use this simple graph to construct an mpeg player later
    in this manual.

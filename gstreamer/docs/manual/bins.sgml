  <title>Bins</title>
  <para> 
    A Bin is a container element. You can add elements to a bin. Since a bin is 
    an <classname>GstElement</classname> itself, it can also be added to another bin.
  </para>
  <para> 
    Bins allow you to combine connected elements into one logical element. You do
    not deal with the individual elements anymore but with just one element, the bin.
    We will see that this is extremely powerfull when you are going to construct
    complex pipelines since it allows you to break up the pipeline in smaller chunks.
  </para>
  <para> 
    The bin will also manage the elements contained in it. It will figure out how
    the data will flow in the bin and generate an optimal plan for that data flow. Plan
    generation is one of the most complicated procedures in GStreamer.

  <para> 
    There are two standard bins available to the GStreamer programmer:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A pipeline (<classname>GstPipeline</classname>). Which is a generic container you will
	  use most of the time.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A thread (<classname>GstThread</classname>). All the elements in the thread bin will 
	  run in a separate thread. You will haver to use this bin if you carfully have to 
	  synchronize audio and video for example. You will learn more about threads in.. <!-- FIXME -->
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para> 
    The application programmer can create custom bins packed with elements to perform a 
    specific task. This allow you to write an MPEG audio decoder with just the follwing lines
    of code:

    <programlisting>

      // create the mp3player element
      GstElement *mp3player = gst_elementfactory_make("mp3player","mp3player");
      // set the source mp3 audio file
      gtk_object_set(GTK_OBJECT(mp3player), "location", "helloworld.mp3", NULL);
      // tell the mp3player to prepare itself
      gst_element_set_state(GST_ELEMENT(mp3player),GST_STATE_READY);
      // start playback
      gst_element_set_state(GST_ELEMENT(mp3player),GST_STATE_PLAYING);
      ...
      // pause playback
      gst_element_set_state(GST_ELEMENT(mp3player),GST_STATE_PAUSED);
      ...
      // stop
      gst_element_set_state(GST_ELEMENT(mp3player),GST_STATE_NULL);
    </programlisting>

    Custom bins can be created with a plugin or an XML description.

    <title>Ghostpads</title>
    <para>
      You can see from figure ... how a bin has no pads of its own. This is where Ghostpads
      come into play. 
    </para>
    <para>
      A ghostpad is a pad from some element in the bin that has been promoted to the bin.
      This way, the bin also has a pad. The bin becomes just another element with a pad and
      you can then use the bin just like any other element. 
    </para>

    </figure>
    <para>
      Above is a representation of a ghostpad. the sinkpad of element one is now also a pad
      of the bin.

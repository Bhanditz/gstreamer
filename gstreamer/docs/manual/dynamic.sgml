  <title>Dynamic pipelines</title>
  <para> 
    this chapter we will see how you can create a dynamic pipleine. A dynamic
    pipeline is a pipeline that is updated or created while media is flowing 
    through it. We will create a partial pipeline first and add more elements
    while the pipeline is playing. Dynamic pipelines cause all sorts of
    scheduling issues and will remain a topic of research for a long time in
    GStreamer.

    We will show how to create an mpeg1 video player using dynamic pipelines.
    As you have seen in the pad section, we can attach a signal to an element
    when a pad is created. We will use this to create our MPEG1 player.

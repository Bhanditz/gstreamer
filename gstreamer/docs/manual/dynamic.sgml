  <title>Dynamic pipelines</title>
  <para> 
    this chapter we will see how you can create a dynamic pipleine. A dynamic
    pipeline is a pipeline that is updated or created while media is flowing 
    through it. We will create a partial pipeline first and add more elements
    while the pipeline is playing. Dynamic pipelines cause all sorts of
    scheduling issues and will remain a topic of research for a long time in
    GStreamer.

        <para>
	You have multiple options available. Our primary method of distribution is by providing tarballs of our releases. You find these tarballs on our
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1936">Sourceforge files page.</ulink>

      <question id="getting-gstreamer">
        <para>Are there premade binaries available ?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>
	Yes, we currently provide precompiled packages for Red Hat, Debian and Linux Mandrake. We provide RPMS for Red Hat through our <ulink url="http://gstreamer.net/releases/redhat/">Apt for rpm page.</ulink> We usually support the last 2-3 releases of Red Hat.
        </para>
	<para>GStreamer is already in Debian experimental, so if you are a debian user you should be able to get Debian from there.</para>
	<para>GStreamer is also in Debian Cooker so if you are using a recent release of Linux Mandrake you should be able to get it from there. <ulink url="http://www.mandrakelinux.com/en/cookerdevel.php3">The Mandrake cooker page has more info</ulink>
	</para>
<para>Other RPM based distro we recommend getting the Source tarball and doing 'rpm -ta gstreamer-0.X.X' to create rpms. We maintain our SPEC file constantly so you should always be able to build GStreamer rpms from a tarball. The SPEC file is aimed at Red Hat however, so there might be some need for you to edit the Requirements list if your distribution name these packages differently.</para>

      <question id="getting-gstreamer">
        <para>Why don't you provide premade binaries for distribution XY ?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>
	GStreamer is run on a volunteer basis. The package that are provided are made by non-paid people who do this on their own time. The distributions we support with binaries are the distributions that we have people who have volunteered to make binaries for. If you are interested in maintaining GStreamer binaries for other distributions or Unices we would be happy to hear from you. Contact us through the GStreamer-devel mailing list.

      <question id="getting-gstreamer">
        <para>I am having trouble compiling GStreamer on my LFS installation, why ?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>
	If you are running LFS our basic opinion is that you should be knowledgeable enough to solve any build issues you get on your own. Being volunteered based we can't promise support to anyone of course, but are you using LFS consider yourself extra unsupported, we
neither can or want to know enough of how you set up your unique system is configured to be able to help you. That said, if you come to the #gstreamer channel on irc.openprojects.net we might of course be able to give you some general hints and pointers.

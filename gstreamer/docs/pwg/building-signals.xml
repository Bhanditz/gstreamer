    Signals can be used to notify applications of events specific to this
    object. Note, however, that the application needs to be aware of signals
    and their meaning, so if you're looking for a generic way for application-
    element interaction, signals are probably not what you're looking for. In
    many cases, however, signals can be very useful. See the GObject
    documentation for all internals about signals.

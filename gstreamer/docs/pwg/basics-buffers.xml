    Buffers are structures used to pass data between elements. All streams of
    data are chopped up into chunks which are stored in buffers. Buffers can be
    of any size, and also contain metadata indicating the type of data contained
    in them. Buffers can be allocated by various different schemes, and may
    either be passed on by elements or unreferenced (and the memory used by the
    buffer freed).

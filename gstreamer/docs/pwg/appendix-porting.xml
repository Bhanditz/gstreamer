  <title>Porting 0.8 plug-ins to 0.9</title>
  <para>
    This section of the appendix will discuss shortly what changes to
    plugins will be needed to quickly and conveniently port most
    applications from &GStreamer;-0.8 to &GStreamer;-0.9, with references
    to the relevant sections in this Plugin Writer's Guide where needed.
    With this list, it should be possible to port most plugins to
    &GStreamer;-0.9 in less than a day.

          Most functions returning an object or an object property have
          been changed to return its own reference rather than a constant
          reference of the one owned by the object itself. The reason for
          this change is primarily threadsafety. This means, effectively,
          that return values of functions such as
          <function>gst_element_get_pad ()</function>,
          <function>gst_pad_get_name ()</function> and many more like these
          have to be free'ed or unreferenced after use. Check the API
          references of each function to know for sure whether return
          values should be free'ed or not.

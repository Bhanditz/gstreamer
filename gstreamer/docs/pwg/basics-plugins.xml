  <title>Plugins</title>
  <para>
    Extensions to &GStreamer; can be made using a plugin mechanism. This is used
    extensively in &GStreamer; even if only the standard package is being used:
    a few very basic functions reside in the core library, and all others are
    implemented in plugins.
  </para>
  <para>
    Plugins are only loaded when needed: a plugin registry is used to store the
    details of the plugins so that it is not neccessary to load all plugins to
    determine which are needed. This registry needs to be updated whenever a new
    plugin is added to the system: see the <emphasis>gst-register</emphasis>
    utility and the documentation in the &GstAppDevMan; for more details.
  </para>
  <para>
    User extensions to &GStreamer; can be installed in the main plugin
    directory, and will immediately be available for use in applications.
    <emphasis>gst-register</emphasis> should be run to update the repository:
    but the system should work correctly even if it hasn't been - it will just
    take longer to load the correct plugin.
  </para>
  <para>
    User specific plugin directories and registries will be available in future
    versions of &GStreamer;.

  <para>
    &GStreamer; has an autoplugging mechanism, which enables application writers
    to simply specify start and end elements for a path, and the system will
    then create a path which links these elements, in accordance with the type
    information provided by the elements.
  </para>
  <para>
    It is possible to devise many different schemes for generating such
    pathways, perhaps to optimise based on special criteria, or with some
    specific constraints. It is thus possible to define new autoplugging
    systems, using the plugin system.

    A type system is used to ensure that the data passed between elements is in
    a recognised format, and that the various parameters required to fully
    specify that format match up correctly. Each connection that is made between
    elements has a specified type. This is related, but different, to the
    metadata in buffers which describes the type of data in that particular
    buffer. See the next chapter of this document for details of the available
    types.

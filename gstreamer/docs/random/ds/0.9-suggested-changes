API:

 - replace object/structure set/get macros with actual functions.

 - events should all use GstStructure


caps:

  (Company:)

  "An idea I had once was to force registration of mimetypes and then
  only allow caps with a registered mimetype - like it's done now with caps.
  You could then add functions to those registrations like
  - gchar *get_human_readable_string (caps);
  should be kinda selfexplanatory. Would return stuff like "16bit signed
  integer audio", "MPEG2 video" or "video format in RGB colorspace" (for
  unfixed RGB)
  - GstCaps *default_fixate (const GstCaps *caps);
  A default fixation function, so we don't fixate to minimum integer
  anymore but have the ability to fixate to 320x240 for video or 44100 for
  audio rates
  - gboolean validate (const GstCaps *caps);
  check if the given caps are ok for this mimetype - debugging only function
  I'd _really_ like to have - especially during gst_register.

  But that's 0.10 material."

- a method for elements to know when downstream elements are ignoring
  the data stream.  This would allow automatic shutoff of pipelines
  whose processing is being dumped.

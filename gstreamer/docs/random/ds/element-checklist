This is a list of things to check in elements.



1. Add a "Element-Checklist-Version: 1" comment

This comment is to indicate which items on this checklist have been
checked, so that future checkers can skip things that you've already
carefully checked.  This number should obviously be updated whenever
you do additional checks.  Ideally, you should not do checks out of
order, but using "1, also 4-6" is acceptable.


2. Each pad should have a pad template

Add a pad template for pads that don't have one.

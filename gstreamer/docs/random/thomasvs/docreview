Documentation review

* gstbuffer
- What are the flags in GstBuffer ? used anywhere ? defined how ?


* General
- how can we define common terms and make them cros-ref'd ?
  e.g. timestamps in buffer, do we say everywhere that they're in nanosec ?


* Style
- when in doubt, try to conform to GTK+ reference docs
- in the arg clarification, use as much cross-reffing as possible.  Do it
  only where it is useful in the explanation text.

- examples

  - use active form instead of imperative describing functions; we describe
    what the function does.
    good : creates a new buffer
    bad : create new buffer
  - use singular for enum names; this makes it more natural to reference to
    it in the API docs
    good : GstBufferFlag
    bad : GstBufferFlags

gstreamer
---------
- reorganize tests and examples into
  - testsuite
    - check: unit tests
    - examples: example code
    - tests: interactive tests
- move gst/base to libs/gst/base ?
  (but elements link against them)
- move elements out of gst/ dir ?

gst-plugins-base
----------------
- gst-libs/gst/audio:
  - is audiofilter still needed ? any reason not to fold it into audio ?

- gst:
  - adder: needs docs, an example, and a test
  - audioconvert: ok
  - audiorate: needs docs
  - audioresample: David needs to fix this
  - audioscale: needs to go
  - audiotestsrc: ok
  - ffmpegcolorspace: needs a test
  - playback: example
  - sine: removed
  - subparse: needs work
  - tags:
    - contained a very small code file that wasn't built, and a copy of a header
      that was in the tag lib; removed

gst-plugins-good
----------------

- gst:
  - alpha, alphacolor: document with example
  - auparse: crashes on e.g.
  gst-launch -v filesrc location=/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/sounds/default-8k/ask-short-question.au ! auparse ! osssink
    -> will move to bad
  - autodetect: OK
  - videofilter:
    - is the lib still needed, given basetransform ?
    - currently installs a lib; should not install, or move to a dir, with pc
      file, possibly in -base
    - if we install it, get AS_LIBTOOL back and use it
- ext:
  - aasink: properties need looking at
    - width, height: why are they there ? caps don't match
    - frames-displayed: in base class ?
    - frame-time: what's this ?
  - cairo:
    - cairotimeoverlay works
    - cairotextoverlay ? pipeline ?
  - flac:
    - flacenc:
gst-launch -v audiotestsrc wave=white-noise ! flacenc ! filesink location=white-noise.flac does not produce a correct file
    - flacdec works, but
gst-launch gnomevfssrc location=http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/media/small/dark.441-16-s.flac ! flacdec ! autoaudiosink
      does not

This talk will present the GStreamer Media framework. We will
explain briefly what a media framework is and what its advantages
are. This introduction will present the basic design of GStreamer
and how the modularity can provide many benefits.

We will then go into more detail about the different components of
the framework and how specific problems were solved, such as 
pipelines, scheduling, state changes, buffers, type negotiation and
events.

We will conclude the presentation with a little demonstration of 
the provided tools and applications.

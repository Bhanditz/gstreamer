GStreamer Filter Writer's Guide
===============================

Outline:

Basic concepts
	Chain vs loop elements
	Scheduling
	Buffers
	Typing and Properties
	Metadata
Building our first filter
	Constructing the boilerplate
		Doing it the easy way with FilterFactory
		  (NOTE: FilterFactory doesn't exist yet)
		Doing it the hard way with G[tk]Object
	An identity filter
		Building an object with pads
		Attaching functions
		The chain function
	The plugin_init function
		Registering the types
		Registering the filter
Building a simple test application
	Initialization
	Instantiating the plugins
	  (NOTE: we really should have a debugging Sink)
	Connecting them
	Running the pipeline
Loop-based Elements
	How scheduling works, aka pushing and pulling
	How a loopfunc works, aka pulling and pushing
	Adding a second output
		Identity is now a tee
		Modifying the test application
Types and Properties
	Building a simple format for testing
	A simple MIME type
	Type properties
	Typefind functions and autopluggin
Buffers and Metadata
	Anatomy of a Buffer
	Refcounts and mutability
	Metadata
		How Properties work efficiently
		Metadata mutability
		  (FIXME: this is an unsolved problem)
Sources and Sinks
	Writing a source
		Pull vs loop based
		Region pulling
		  (NOTE: somewhere explain how filters use this)
	Writing a sink
		Gee, that was easy
State management
	What are states?
	Mangaging filter state

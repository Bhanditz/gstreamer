GstElementFactory:

Base class for all elementfactories.  Is a single-instance (per program)
object that creates objects of the associated GstElement derivative.


GstPlugin:

Defines a given plugin.  Records plugin name, function pointers, details,
etc.  Includes a list of GstElementFactories that are associated with
this plugin.

GstObject:

Base class for all streamer objects (duh), defines some basic stuff like a
pointer to the master pipeline for the object.


GstBin:

Contains a bunch of GstObjects.


GstPipeline:

A bin that can be used raw in an application.  The object that gets
embedded into applications.  Can contain any set of GstObjects.  Nothing
but a convenience object for the moment, will eventually be *the* object
dealt with externally.


GstThread:

A bin that will become a thread if possible when the pipeline is started
up.  Can contain any set of GstObjects except another GstThread.  All
starting points and/or clocked events must be registered with this object,
to be dealt with in the separate thread.

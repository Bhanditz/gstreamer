Release TODO
------------

* make distcheck should pass

* test suite should pass

* autotools have latest config.{guess,sub}
  This is needed in order to support newer platforms.
  On Debian install the autotools-dev package to get these.

* depending on how the API has changed update the libtool versioning
  in configure.ac.  Look at the libtool info page about versioning for
  guidelines.

* update package version

* tag tree
  http://gstreamer.net/dev/cvs.php
  add tag to above page

* update web site release notes

* update web site news items for release

* upload to sourceforge

* announce to:
  freshmeat
  gstreamer-{devel, announce}
  linux-audio-dev (?)
  gnome lists (?)
  lwn (if it's a big release)


Should work:

* autoconf feature to allow building outside source dir



Package version policy
----------------------

Use major.minor.micro versioning

Before 1.0.0

Update micro until code and API are fairly stable, then update minor.


After 1.0.0

Update major when code and api hit new level of stability or major features.
Update minor on API changes.
Update micro on API-compatible changes.

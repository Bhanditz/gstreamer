Here's a possible (huge, large, complete?) sequence of execution for an
invocation of [GIST] playing a media stream.  I'll start with a mp3 audio
stream, but eventually this should be a mpeg a/v stream off the net with
rolling capture (think ReplayTV/Tivo), pausing, rewinding, etc.  This
could easily be hundreds of lines by the time I'm done...

This may look a lot like C in places, simply because that's the most
efficient way of representing a given action.


gst_init();
pipeline = gst_pipeline_new();
	state = 
src = gst_disksrc_new("src","song.mp3");

* cleanup of dparams
  * resolve g_return_if_fail() into GST_WARNING and return()
    in cases where the caller has to handle the problem
  * rename
    GST_TYPE_DPSMOOTH to GST_TYPE_DPARAM_SMOOTH
    GST_TYPE_DP_LININT to GST_TYPE_DPARAM_LININT
    there seems to be nobody using them, as they still look unfinished

* concept for global, voice params

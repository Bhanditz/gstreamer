* cleanup of dparams
  * even though it is long try to stick to the prefix "dparam" for the whole library
      * e.g. avoid namespace clashes with "dataprotocol" which is using "dp" as well :-(
  * resolve g_return_if_fail() into GST_WARNING and return()
    in cases where the caller has to handle the problem
  * rename
    GST_TYPE_DPSMOOTH to GST_TYPE_DPARAM_SMOOTH
    GST_TYPE_DP_LININT to GST_TYPE_DPARAM_LININT
    there seems to be nobody using them, as they still look unfinished
  * move modes into extra modules
    dparam_mode_synchronous
    dparam_mode_asynchronous
    dparam_mode_disabled

* documentation
  * state of unitconvert
  * state of sychronous params

* dparams ng
  * concept for global, voice params
    one plugin instance can repeate the processing for the same input, but with
    different parameter sets (sound synthesizers, effects)
  * based on gobject params, so that e.g. the GUI can connect to "notify:param"
    events and update the GUI

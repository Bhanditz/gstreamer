== index handling ==

For avidemux I currently have a big patch doing memory optimized index handling.
It basically thins out the index to save memory. Right now it only keeps index
entries marked with the avi keyframe flag.

In gstreamer core we have some indexing objects. They are curently used nowhere.
The idea is to use them and to make the index strategy plugable or configurable
at run time.

The challenge is then to rewrite muxers and demuxers to use them instead of the
built in index logic.

This way the different requirements of desktop and embedded platforms could be
encapsulated in the indexer strategy.

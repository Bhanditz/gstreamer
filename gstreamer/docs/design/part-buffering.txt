Buffering
---------

This document outlines the buffering policy used in the GStreamer
core that can be used by plugins and applications.

The purpose of buffering is to accumulate enough data in a pipeline so that
playback can occur smoothly and without interruptions. It is typically done when
reading from a (slow) and non-live network source.

While data is buffered, the pipeline should remain in the PAUSED state. It is
also possible that more data should be buffered while the pipeline is PLAYING,
in which case the pipeline should be PAUSED until the buffering finished.

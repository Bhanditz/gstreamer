<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
Media library supporting arbitrary formats and filter graphs.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
GStreamer is a framework for constructing graphs of various filters
(termed elements here) that will handly streaming media.  Any discreet
(packetizable) media type is supported, with provisions for automatically
determining source type.  Metadata can be passed with all data to provide
formatting/framing information.  Plugins are heavily used to provide for
all elements, allowing one to construct plugins outside of the GST
library, even released binary-only if license require (please don't).
</para>

<para>
GStreamer borrows heavily from both the <ulink 
url="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/sysl/">OGI media pipeline</ulink> and
Microsoft's DirectShow, hopefully taking the best of both and leaving the
cruft behind.  Its interface is still very fluid (I've redesigned the
metadata handling twice already), and thus can be changed to increase the
sanity/noise ratio.

<!-- ##### MACRO DEBUG ##### -->
<para>
Use this macro to show debugging info. This is only usefull when developing new
plugin elements.
If you #define DEBUG_ENABLED before including gst/gst.h, this macro will produce
g_print messages.

@format: the format specification as in g_print
@args...: arguments

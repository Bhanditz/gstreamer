%  Part 3: Array and other sizes for TeX (and Metafont and MetaPost).
% 
% If you want to change some of these sizes only for a certain TeX
% variant, the usual dot notation works, e.g.,
% main_memory.hugetex = 20000000
% 
% If a change here appears to be ignored, try redumping the format file.

% Memory. Must be less than 8,000,000 total.
% 
% main_memory is relevant only to initex, extra_mem_* only to non-ini.
% Thus, have to redump the .fmt file after changing main_memory; to add
% to existing fmt files, increase extra_mem_*.  (To get an idea of how
% much, try \tracingstats=2 in your TeX source file;
% web2c/tests/memtest.tex might also be interesting.)
% 
% To increase space for boxes (as might be needed by, e.g., PiCTeX),
% increase extra_mem_bot.
% 
% For some xy-pic samples, you may need as much as 700000 words of memory.
% For the vast majority of documents, 60000 or less will do.

% work unless `unsigned short' is not supported or is smaller than 16
% bits.  This value should suffice for UK English, US English, French,
% and German (for example).  To increase, you must change
% `ssup_trie_opcode' and `ssup_trie_size' in tex.ch (and rebuild TeX);
% the trie will then consume four bytes per entry, instead of two.
% 
% US English, German, and Portuguese: 30000.
% German: 14000.
% US English: 10000.

% Buffer size.  TeX uses the buffer to contain input lines, but macro
% expansion works by writing material into the buffer and reparsing the

% handled within a tenth of this size.

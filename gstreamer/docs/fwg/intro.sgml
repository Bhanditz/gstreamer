    <application>GStreamer</application> is a framework for creating
    streaming media applications.  It is extremely powerful and versatile,
    and this versatility stems in part from its modularity, and its ability
    to incorporate new modules seamlessly into its framework.

      This guide explains how to write new modules for GStreamer.  It is
      relevant to:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  Anyone who wants to add support for new input and output
          devices, often called sources and sinks.  For example,
	  adding the ability to write to a new video output system
	  could be done by writing an appropriate sink plugin.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  Anyone who wants to add support for new ways of processing
	  data in GStreamer, often called
	  filters.  For example, a new data format converter could be
	  created.
        </listitem>
	<listitem>
	  Anyone who wants to extend GStreamer in
	  any way: you need to have an understanding of how the plugin system
	  works before you can understand the constraints it places on the
	  rest of the code.  And you might be surprised at how much can be
	  done with plugins.

      This guide is not relevant to you if you only want to use the existing
      functionality of GStreamer, or use an application which uses GStreamer.
      You lot can go away.  Shoo...  (You might find the <emphasis>GStreamer
      Application Development Manual</emphasis> helpful though.)

	The reader should be familiar with the basic workings of
	<application>GStreamer</application>.  For a gentle introduction to
	GStreamer, you may wish to read the <emphasis>GStreamer Application
	Development Manual</emphasis>.  Since
	<application>GStreamer</application> adheres to the GTK+ programming
	model, the reader is also assumed to understand the basics of GTK+.

 * Theory of operation:
 * When connecting a sink to a source, GstSpiderConnections are used to keep track
 * of the current status of the link. sink -> src is the path we intend to
 * plug. current is how far we've come. If current equals
 * - NULL, there is no possible path, 
 * - src, the link is established.
 * - sink, it wasn't tried to establish a link.
 * - something else, we have come that far while plugging.
 * signal_id is used to remember the signal_id when we are waiting for a "new_pad"
 * callback during link.
 * When a path is established, the elements in the path (excluding sink and src)
 * are refcounted once for every path.
 * A GstSpider keeps a list of all GstSpiderConnections in it.

The naming hiearchy you'll see bits of but never the whole thing is
basically container:container:container:element.pad, which reflects
parentage.  When naming connections between elements, those are the what
will be used, possibly along with .. as container to indicate 'up one'.  I
don't think this will ever by used, since ghost pads are supposed to make
all connections between elements with the same parent.

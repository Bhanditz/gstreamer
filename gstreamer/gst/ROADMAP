***** Core *****
gst.c
	Contains initialization functions, etc.

gstobject.c
	The core object type for all of the Gst objects.  Handles
	refcounting, parenting, etc.

gsttype.c
	Media type registry, keeping track of all registered media types.
	Each type has an ID, MIME type, and a list of elements that will
	either source or sink the type.

gstmeta.c
	Provides some common routines for dealing with metadata.

gstplugin.c
	Plugin operations, finding and loading shared library plugins, as
	well as a simple plugin registry.

[gstregistry.c]
[	Maintains an on-disk cache of elements installed on system,
	provides for full searching across various tidbits per plugin. ]

***** Major object types *****
gstelement.c
	All pipeline elements are based on this type, which defines the
	padlist, etc.

gstelementfactory.c
	A simple object used to generate new elements from plugins.

gstbuffer.c
	Defines the data buffers that are passed between elements.
	Buffers have a type (see gsttype.c), flags, as well as data and
	metadata information.  Metadata comes in list form.

gstpad.c
	The connective pads for elements.  Keeps track of media type and
	direction.  Connects to a peer pad and swaps chain [and push]
	function[s], allowing buffers to be passed with two function
	calls.  Allows ghostparenting to bins.

***** Element tpoes ***
gstbin.c
	Contains any number of elements, and can be operated on as an
	element itself.  Contains a list of child elements, and enables
	ghostparenting of pads.

gstpipeline.c
	Special case of gstbin that handles the whole pipeline concept.

gstthread.c
	Special case of gstbin that creates a thread and iterates in that,
	allowing for fully threaded operation.

gstsrc.c
	Special case of gstelement that provides a generic push()
	function.

gstfilter.c
	Special case of gstelement mostly for administrative purposes.

gstsink.c
	Special case of gstelement mostly for administrative purposes.

gsttee.c
	Pipe fitting.

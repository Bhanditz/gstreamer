	* gstmediaplay.glade: Added a basic preferences dialog, not hooked
	up yet.

	* callbacks.c (on_preferences1_activate): Added loading the new
	preferences dialog.

	* Makefile.am: Removed full-screen.[c,h] from the build.

	* full-screen.h: Removed this file, no longer needed.

	* full-screen.c: Removed this file, no longer needed.

	* gstplay.c (gst_play_get_video_widget): New function to return
	the actual video_widget.
	(gst_play_get_source_width): New function to get the width of the
	source media.
	(gst_play_get_source_height): New function to get the height of
	the source media.
	(gst_play_set_uri): Added check to make sure the file we are
	trying to play actually exists. i wonder if this fails with

	(on_double_size_activate): Use the new function.
	(on_full_screen_activate): Use the new function.

	prototypes for the new functions.

	* gstmediaplay.c (gst_media_play_start_uri): Added a check for the
	return value of set_uri so that we don't crash on not being able
	to load a file.
	(gst_media_play_set_original_size): New function to size the
	video_widget to its default size.
	(gst_media_play_set_fullscreen): New function to do
	full-screen. Still a hack but at least this one works.

	video_widget to double its default size.

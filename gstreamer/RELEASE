GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer 0.8.4 "Paella"
        

The GStreamer team is happy to announce a new release
in the 0.8.x stable series of the GStreamer streaming-media framework.


The 0.8.x series is a stable series aimed at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.6.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.6.x series.


This module only contains core functionality.  For actual media playback,
you will need other modules.  GStreamer Plugins contains a huge set of
additional plugins.  GStreamer FFmpeg contains a plugin based on the popular
FFmpeg decoding library.  These modules need not have the same source version
as the core, as long as they are in the 0.8.x series.

  
Features of this release
    
      * Parallel installability with 0.6.x series
      * Internationalization
      * New Translation: Czech (cs), Miloslav Trmac
      * New Translation: Catalan (ca), Jordi Mallach
      * Translations: af, az, cs, en_GB, fr, nl, sr, sv, tr, uk
      * gst_init () now behaves like gtk_init ()
      * queue fixes
      * ongoing win32 build integration
      * bytestream now has GstFilePad
      * gst-register is now i18n-ized
      * GstCaps XML-ization works again
      * Fixed enum GValue
      * Added GstFraction GValue

Known issues
    
      * Some applications may print warnings on the console saying
something like:
 GStreamer-WARNING **: pad xvimagesink0:sink returned caps that are not a
real subset of its template caps.

It is safe to ignore this warning.  It will be fixed in the next release
of the GStreamer Plugins.

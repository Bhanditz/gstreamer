GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer 0.8.5 "Stuttgart"
        

The GStreamer team is happy to announce a new release
in the 0.8.x stable series of the GStreamer streaming-media framework.


The 0.8.x series is a stable series aimed at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.6.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.6.x series.


This is the first GStreamer release that compiles with MSVC7 with full
debug support. Installation of the binaries and the locales are also handled.


This module only contains core functionality.  For actual media playback,
you will need other modules.  GStreamer Plugins contains a huge set of
additional plugins.  GStreamer FFmpeg contains a plugin based on the popular
FFmpeg decoding library.  These modules need not have the same source version
as the core, as long as they are in the 0.8.x series.

API changed in this release
     

- API additions:
    
* A new function, gst_scheduler_register, has been added.
* A new enum member of GstBufferFlag, GST_BUFFER_DELTA_UNIT has been added.

- API depreciations:
    
* GstBufferFlag has a deprecated enum member, GST_BUFFER_KEY_UNIT.
Buffers should be marked with GST_BUFFER_DELTA_UNIT when they're not
key units instead, since key units are the more common case.

GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer 0.7.6 "Almost"
        

The GStreamer team is happy to announce a new release in the
0.7.x development series of the GStreamer streaming-media framework.
The goal of this release series is to stabilize towards a 0.8
release series which will be part of the GNOME 2.6 releases
and hopefully eventually KDE 4.x. 


0.7.6 is a Release Candidate for GStreamer 0.8.0
It is released to shake out the last bugs that might be still present
due to major/minor number differences.


The 0.7 series is a development series and is aimed at developers.
It is NOT API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.6.x series or
with other releases in the series.  This means you can not use this
release to upgrade your current GStreamer installation and expect your
GStreamer applications to keep working without a recompile.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.6.x series.

  
Features of this release
    
      * uses 0.8 as the major/minor number
      * opt scheduler fixes
      * don't link non-versioned tools to gstreamer
      * bindings-related fixes and additions

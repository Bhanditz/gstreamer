GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer 0.9.2 "South"
        

The GStreamer team is petrified to announce a new release
in the 0.9.x development series of the
core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.


The 0.9.x series is a development series and not recommended for end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.


The main focus of the 0.9 series is to make GStreamer threadsafe.


This module, gstreamer, only contains core functionality.
For actual media playback, you will need other modules.

gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plug-ins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect

will create more lists as necessary.

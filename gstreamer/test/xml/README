This is my test code for reading and writing an XML registry of the
plugins.  This will be eventually folded back into the main library, such
that when you query the list of plugins, you get all the plugins that are
either loaded or listed in the registry.  When you actually ask for a
given plugin, it will load it if necessary.  Pretty cool, huh?

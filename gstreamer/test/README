This is a collection of test programs of all sorts, ranging from the first
version of GiST to the simple hard-disk recorder used in the Oct
31, 1999 inaugural run of GStreamer in a 'real' environment.  Not all are
included, because most are obsolete.  All the stuff you see in the first
line of the Makefile.am (commented out) is both old and broken.

One of these days test/ will turn back into a real test-suite for
GStreamer, but for now it's my sandbox.

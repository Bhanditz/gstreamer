/*
 * This file reproduces the bug in the bugreport #143777, as can be seen at
 * http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143777 - the issue is that when
 * pausing a pipeline while the chainhandler is still running, then unlinking
 * the pad that's chain function is called and relinking it clears the buffer
 * that was stored for sending the event. gst_pad_call_chain_function needs
 * to check that.
 * The fix is in gstpad.c, revision 1.327

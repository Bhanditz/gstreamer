This is gnome-streamer, a framework for streaming media in GNOME.  The
fundamental design comes from the video pipeline at Oregon Graduate
Institute, as well as some ideas from DirectMedia.  It's based on plug-ins
that will provide the various codec and other functionality.  The
interface hopefully is generic enough for various companies (ahem, Apple)
to release binary codecs for Linux, until such time as they get a clue and
release the source.


Developer note:  When building from CVS sources, you will need to run
autogen.sh to generate the build system files.

Unfortunately, there is a bug in automake which causes it to use a large
amount of memory when generating plugins/Makefile.in.  The following patch,
which you may wish to apply to automake (version 1.4), fixes this problem.
It is also fixed in versions of automake 1.4f and later.
Alternatively, ensure that you have at least 512Mb of memory on your system,
and be prepared to wait a little while when running automake (or autogen.sh).

The autogen.sh script will automatically detect an unpatched automake and give
a warning.  It will also generate a patched version of automake in the top
build directory, which you can use by putting it in a directory in your $PATH
ahead of the unpatched version of automake.

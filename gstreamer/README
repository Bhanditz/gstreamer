This is gnome-streamer, a framework for streaming media in GNOME.  The
fundamental design comes from the video pipeline at Oregon Graduate
Institute, as well as some ideas from DirectMedia.  It's based on plug-ins
that will provide the various codec and other functionality.  The
interface hopefully is generic enough for various companies (ahem, Apple)
to release binary codecs for Linux, until such time as they get a clue and
release the source.


Developer note:  When building from CVS sources, you will need to run
autogen.sh to generate the build system files.

Unfortunately, there is a bug in automake which causes it to use a large
amount of memory when generating plugins/Makefile.in.  The following patch,
which you may wish to apply to automake (version 1.4), fixes this problem.
Alternatively, ensure that you have at least 128Mb of memory on your system,
and be prepared to wait a little while when running automake (or autogen.sh).

The automake developers have been notified of this problem, and supplied with
an equivalent patch against CVS head.

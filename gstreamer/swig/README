Perl bindings for Gstreamer
thomas@apestaart.org, August 2001

This is work in progress.  

Here's some basic instructions :

* configure gstreamer
* run ./bootstrap in this directory; this will create a symbolic link to
Gst.so which will be made later on so that you can test the module without
installing it.
* run helloworld.pl /path/to/mp3

Some of the gstreamer functions are wrapped up now, we'll change that
later.

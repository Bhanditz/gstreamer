This is a visualization based on on the monoscope output plugin from
alsaplayer.

The monoscope convolution matching code was written by Ralph Loader.

The monoscope.c and monoscope.h files are the only ones under the GPL,
as opposed to the LGPL. We need to either rewrite these or get permission
from the people involved to do so.

This implementation is taken from alsaplayer version 0.99.54, at
http://www.alsaplayer.org/

Note: only one instance of this plugin may be created at a time: it has a
lot of static data.  This should be fixed (and it shouldn't be hard to do
so, either).

* What is UDP src/sink?

This plugin is *not* meant to be a professional stream broadcast
solution, like icecast or realaudio or whatever.

This plugin is basically for testing and simple hacks: raw audio
or packetized gsm should be fine.


* Shortcomings

Even given our modest ambitions, the current code is doesn't handle
caps negotiation robustly.


* Todo

This plugin should offer different modes for caps negotiation: none,
udp, or tcp.  The udp mode should include the caps every five packets
(approx).  The tcp mode can do bi-directional negotiation.

Perhaps this plugin can be the example of how to do caps negotiation
via a point-to-point protocol.

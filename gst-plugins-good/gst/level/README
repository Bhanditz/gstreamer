level plugin by thomas <thomas@apestaart.org>

this plugin signals:
  - channel
  - RMS level
  - peak level
  - decaying peak level
over the given interval.

This is useful for a VU meter display and for plotting out the signal graph.
The VU meter can either display RMS, or display immediate peak level and
have the falloff decaying peak level displayed as a line.

The interval for signal emission, ttl of decay peak, and falloff of decay peak
can all be set.

The element only takes unsigned data in; it could be extended to signed as
well, if separate fast chain functions are made that displaces the incoming
data to its midpoint (ie, 0,65535 should be mapped to -32768, 32767)

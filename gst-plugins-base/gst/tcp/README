* What is TCP src/sink?

solution, like icecast or realaudio or whatever. But the future RTP plugins shall not do the actual transmission/reception of packets on the network themselve but the Application developer would be encouraged to use either the TCP or the UDP plugins for that. UDP would be used mostly but there could be situations where TCP would be the only available choice. For example streaming accross firewalls that do not allow UDP.

* Shortcomings

Even given our modest ambitions, the current code doesn't handle
caps negotiation robustly.

* Todo

The caps nego should do bi-directional negotiation.

Perhaps this plugin can be the example of how to do caps negotiation
via a point-to-point protocol.

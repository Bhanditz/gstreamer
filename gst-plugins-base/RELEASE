GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer Base Plug-ins 0.10.4 "Power"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the
GStreamer Base Plug-ins.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.



This module contains a set of reference plugins, base classes for other
plugins, and helper libraries.

This module is kept up-to-date together with the core developments.  Element
writers should look at the elements in this module as a reference for
their development.

This module contains elements for, among others:

  device plugins: x(v)imagesink, alsa, v4lsrc, cdparanoia
  containers: ogg
  codecs: vorbis, theora
  text: textoverlay, subparse
  sources: audiotestsrc, videotestsrc, gnomevfssrc
  network: tcp
  typefind
  audio processing: audioconvert, adder, audiorate, audioscale, volume
  visualisation: libvisual
  video processing: ffmpegcolorspace
  aggregate elements: decodebin, playbin


Other modules containing plug-ins are:


gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect
